### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Aleksandr

I'm an aspiring fullstack developer with good taste ;)

I have been studying web development for a total of 1 year, which I turned into self-education and offline courses at Elbrus Bootcamp programming school, where I gained fundamental knowledge to develop commercial web applications.

I am currently looking for a job and an experienced team with an interesting project where I can prove myself and help to create a cool product!

Skills: React, Redux Toolkit, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS
